    Projection that may be projected along with other supported volume types

    Attributes
    ----------
    clusterTrustBundle : ClusterTrustBundleProjection, default is Undefined, optional
        ClusterTrustBundle allows a pod to access the `.spec.trustBundle` field of ClusterTrustBundle objects in an auto-updating file.

        Alpha, gated by the ClusterTrustBundleProjection feature gate.

        ClusterTrustBundle objects can either be selected by name, or by the combination of signer name and a label selector.

        Kubelet performs aggressive normalization of the PEM contents written into the pod filesystem.  Esoteric PEM features such as inter-block comments and block headers are stripped.  Certificates are deduplicated. The ordering of certificates within the file is arbitrary, and Kubelet may change the order over time.
    configMap : ConfigMapProjection, default is Undefined, optional
        configMap information about the configMap data to project
    downwardAPI : DownwardAPIProjection, default is Undefined, optional
        downwardAPI information about the downwardAPI data to project
    secret : SecretProjection, default is Undefined, optional
        secret information about the secret data to project
    serviceAccountToken : ServiceAccountTokenProjection, default is Undefined, optional
        serviceAccountToken is information about the serviceAccountToken data to project
