schema PodResourceClaimStatus:
    """
    PodResourceClaimStatus is stored in the PodStatus for each PodResourceClaim which references a ResourceClaimTemplate. It stores the generated name for the corresponding ResourceClaim.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name : str, default is Undefined, required
        Name uniquely identifies this resource claim inside the pod. This must match the name of an entry in pod.spec.resourceClaims, which implies that the string must be a DNS_LABEL.
    resourceClaimName : str, default is Undefined, optional
        ResourceClaimName is the name of the ResourceClaim that was generated for the Pod in the namespace of the Pod. It this is unset, then generating a ResourceClaim was not necessary. The pod.spec.resourceClaims entry can be ignored in this case.
