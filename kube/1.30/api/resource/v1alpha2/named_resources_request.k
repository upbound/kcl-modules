    ----------
    selector : str, default is Undefined, required
        Selector is a CEL expression which must evaluate to true if a resource instance is suitable. The language is as defined in https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/cel/

        In addition, for each type NamedResourcesin AttributeValue there is a map that resolves to the corresponding value of the instance under evaluation. For example:

           attributes.quantity["a"].isGreaterThan(quantity("0")) &&
           attributes.stringslice["b"].isSorted()
