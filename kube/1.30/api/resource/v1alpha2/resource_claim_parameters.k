    """
    ResourceClaimParameters defines resource requests for a ResourceClaim in an in-tree format understood by Kubernetes.

    Attributes
    ----------
    apiVersion : str, default is "resource.k8s.io/v1alpha2", required
        APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
    driverRequests : [DriverRequests], default is Undefined, optional
        DriverRequests describes all resources that are needed for the allocated claim. A single claim may use resources coming from different drivers. For each driver, this array has at most one entry which then may have one or more per-driver requests.

        May be empty, in which case the claim can always be allocated.
    generatedFrom : ResourceClaimParametersReference, default is Undefined, optional
        If this object was created from some other resource, then this links back to that resource. This field is used to find the in-tree representation of the claim parameters when the parameter reference of the claim refers to some unknown type.
    kind : str, default is "ResourceClaimParameters", required
        Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
    metadata : v1.ObjectMeta, default is Undefined, optional
        Standard object metadata
    shareable : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        Shareable indicates whether the allocated claim is meant to be shareable by multiple consumers at the same time.
