schema LeaseSpec:
    r"""
    LeaseSpec is a specification of a Lease.

    Attributes
    ----------
    acquireTime : str, default is Undefined, optional
        acquireTime is a time when the current lease was acquired.
    holderIdentity : str, default is Undefined, optional
        holderIdentity contains the identity of the holder of a current lease. If Coordinated Leader Election is used, the holder identity must be equal to the elected LeaseCandidate.metadata.name field.
    leaseDurationSeconds : int, default is Undefined, optional
        leaseDurationSeconds is a duration that candidates for a lease need to wait to force acquire it. This is measured against the time of last observed renewTime.
    leaseTransitions : int, default is Undefined, optional
        leaseTransitions is the number of transitions of a lease between holders.
    preferredHolder : str, default is Undefined, optional
        PreferredHolder signals to a lease holder that the lease has a more optimal holder and should be given up. This field can only be set if Strategy is also set.
    renewTime : str, default is Undefined, optional
        renewTime is a time when the current holder of a lease has last updated the lease.
    strategy : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Strategy indicates the strategy for picking the leader for coordinated leader election. If the field is not specified, there is no active coordination for this lease. (Alpha) Using this field requires the CoordinatedLeaderElection feature gate to be enabled.
