schema ResourceSliceSpec:
    r"""
    ResourceSliceSpec contains the information published by the driver in one ResourceSlice.

    Attributes
    ----------
    allNodes : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        AllNodes indicates that all nodes have access to the resources in the pool.

        Exactly one of NodeName, NodeSelector and AllNodes must be set.
    devices : [Device], default is Undefined, optional
        Devices lists some or all of the devices in this pool.

        Must not have more than 128 entries.
    driver : str, default is Undefined, required
        Driver identifies the DRA driver providing the capacity information. A field selector can be used to list only ResourceSlice objects with a certain driver name.

        Must be a DNS subdomain and should end with a DNS domain owned by the vendor of the driver. This field is immutable.
    nodeName : str, default is Undefined, optional
        NodeName identifies the node which provides the resources in this pool. A field selector can be used to list only ResourceSlice objects belonging to a certain node.

        This field can be used to limit access from nodes to ResourceSlices with the same node name. It also indicates to autoscalers that adding new nodes of the same type as some old node might also make new resources available.

        Exactly one of NodeName, NodeSelector and AllNodes must be set. This field is immutable.
    nodeSelector : v1.NodeSelector, default is Undefined, optional
        NodeSelector defines which nodes have access to the resources in the pool, when that pool is not limited to a single node.

        Must use exactly one term.

        Exactly one of NodeName, NodeSelector and AllNodes must be set.
    pool : ResourcePool, default is Undefined, required
        Pool describes the pool that this ResourceSlice belongs to.
