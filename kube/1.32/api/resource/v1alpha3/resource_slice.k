schema ResourceSlice:
    r"""
    ResourceSlice represents one or more resources in a pool of similar resources, managed by a common driver. A pool may span more than one ResourceSlice, and exactly how many ResourceSlices comprise a pool is determined by the driver.

    At the moment, the only supported resources are devices with attributes and capacities. Each device in a given pool, regardless of how many ResourceSlices, must have a unique name. The ResourceSlice in which a device gets published may change over time. The unique identifier for a device is the tuple <driver name>, <pool name>, <device name>.

    Whenever a driver needs to update a pool, it increments the pool.Spec.Pool.Generation number and updates all ResourceSlices with that new number and new resource definitions. A consumer must only use ResourceSlices with the highest generation number and ignore all others.

    When allocating all resources in a pool matching certain criteria or when looking for the best solution among several different alternatives, a consumer should check the number of ResourceSlices in a pool (included in each ResourceSlice) to determine whether its view of a pool is complete and if not, should wait until the driver has completed updating the pool.

    For resources that are not local to a node, the node name is not set. Instead, the driver may use a node selector to specify where the devices are available.

    This is an alpha type and requires enabling the DynamicResourceAllocation feature gate.

    Attributes
    ----------
    apiVersion : str, default is "resource.k8s.io/v1alpha3", required
        APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
    kind : str, default is "ResourceSlice", required
        Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
    metadata : v1.ObjectMeta, default is Undefined, optional
        Standard object metadata
    spec : ResourceSliceSpec, default is Undefined, required
        Contains the information published by the driver.

        Changing the spec automatically increments the metadata.generation number.
