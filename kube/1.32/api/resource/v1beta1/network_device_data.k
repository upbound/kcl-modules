    hardwareAddress : str, default is Undefined, optional
        HardwareAddress represents the hardware address (e.g. MAC Address) of the device's network interface.

        Must not be longer than 128 characters.
    interfaceName : str, default is Undefined, optional
        InterfaceName specifies the name of the network interface associated with the allocated device. This might be the name of a physical or virtual network interface being configured in the pod.
