schema AllocatedDeviceStatus:
    r"""
    AllocatedDeviceStatus contains the status of an allocated device, if the driver chooses to report it. This may include driver-specific information.

    Attributes
    ----------
    conditions : [v1.Condition], default is Undefined, optional
        Conditions contains the latest observation of the device's state. If the device has been configured according to the class and claim config references, the `Ready` condition should be True.
    data : any, default is Undefined, optional
        Data contains arbitrary driver-specific data.

        The length of the raw data must be smaller or equal to 10 Ki.
    device : str, default is Undefined, required
        Device references one device instance via its name in the driver's resource pool. It must be a DNS label.
    driver : str, default is Undefined, required
        Driver specifies the name of the DRA driver whose kubelet plugin should be invoked to process the allocation once the claim is needed on a node.

        Must be a DNS subdomain and should end with a DNS domain owned by the vendor of the driver.
    networkData : NetworkDeviceData, default is Undefined, optional
        NetworkData contains network-related information specific to the device.
    pool : str, default is Undefined, required
        This name together with the driver name and the device name field identify which device was allocated (`<driver name>/<pool name>/<device name>`).

        Must not be longer than 253 characters and may contain one or more DNS sub-domains separated by slashes.
