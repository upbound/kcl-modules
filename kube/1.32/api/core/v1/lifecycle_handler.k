schema LifecycleHandler:
    r"""
    LifecycleHandler defines a specific action that should be taken in a lifecycle hook. One and only one of the fields, except TCPSocket must be specified.

    Attributes
    ----------
    exec : ExecAction, default is Undefined, optional
        Exec specifies a command to execute in the container.
    httpGet : HTTPGetAction, default is Undefined, optional
        HTTPGet specifies an HTTP GET request to perform.
    sleep : SleepAction, default is Undefined, optional
        Sleep represents a duration that the container should sleep.
    tcpSocket : TCPSocketAction, default is Undefined, optional
        Deprecated. TCPSocket is NOT supported as a LifecycleHandler and kept for backward compatibility. There is no validation of this field and lifecycle hooks will fail at runtime when it is specified.
