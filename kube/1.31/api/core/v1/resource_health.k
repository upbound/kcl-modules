schema ResourceHealth:
    r"""
    ResourceHealth represents the health of a resource. It has the latest device health information. This is a part of KEP https://kep.k8s.io/4680 and historical health changes are planned to be added in future iterations of a KEP.

    Attributes
    ----------
    health : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Health of the resource. can be one of:
         - Healthy: operates as normal
         - Unhealthy: reported unhealthy. We consider this a temporary health issue
                      since we do not have a mechanism today to distinguish
                      temporary and permanent issues.
         - Unknown: The status cannot be determined.
                    For example, Device Plugin got unregistered and hasn't been re-registered since.

        In future we may want to introduce the PermanentlyUnhealthy Status.
    resourceID : str, default is Undefined, required
        ResourceID is the unique identifier of the resource. See the ResourceID type for more information.
