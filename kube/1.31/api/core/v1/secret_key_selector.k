schema SecretKeySelector:

    SecretKeySelector selects a key of a Secret.

    Attributes
    ----------
    key : str, default is Undefined, required
        The key of the secret to select from.  Must be a valid secret key.
    name : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Name of the referent. This field is effectively required, but due to backwards compatibility is allowed to be empty. Instances of this type with an empty value here are almost certainly wrong. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names
    optional : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        Specify whether the Secret or its key must be defined
