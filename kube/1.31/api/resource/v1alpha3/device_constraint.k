schema DeviceConstraint:
    r"""
    DeviceConstraint must have exactly one field set besides Requests.

    Attributes
    ----------
    matchAttribute : str, default is Undefined, optional
        MatchAttribute requires that all devices in question have this attribute and that its type and value are the same across those devices.

        For example, if you specified "dra.example.com/numa" (a hypothetical example!), then only devices in the same NUMA node will be chosen. A device which does not have that attribute will not be chosen. All devices should use a value of the same type for this attribute because that is part of its specification, but if one device doesn't, then it also will not be chosen.

        Must include the domain qualifier.
    requests : [str], default is Undefined, optional
        Requests is a list of the one or more requests in this claim which must co-satisfy this constraint. If a request is fulfilled by multiple devices, then all of the devices must satisfy the constraint. If this is not specified, this constraint applies to all requests in this claim.
